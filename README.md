Data Security Lab

To run the program please repeat the following:
- First run the Server main method
- Then run the Client main method

Once the client method is run you will now have the option of running the different methods available to a client.

Note that a waiting time of 2 seconds has been added after some print statements. This way clients can read print statements before the program continues.

Please also note that the PrintService file contains the names for valid printer and file names when testing print methods.
